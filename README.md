Hello guys here I have build DIY Arduino based 2D wire bending machine, using some stepper motors, 
and 3D printed parts.


I have use arduino nano for this project, this machine can shape wire in some 2D geometrical figures.
I have write code for some 5 basic shapes like, Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Hexagon & spiral.
What shape and size you want to bend can be define from serial monitor.


In this way it became very flexible and user friendly, don’t need to upload new code for new shape.
More complex shape can also possible, for that we need to write code and upload to arduino.


This DIY Arduino based 2D wire bending machine is fun to build on your own, if you are students this will be good project for your academic project.

Refer the above circuit diagram to do wiring, I have use 12V 2A external power supply to power arduino and stepper motor.
A4988 driver module is use to operate Nema17 stepper motor, 

if your stepper motor get unstable or moving some random steps during start up so you can connect step pin and GND pin with 1K ohm resistor.

Bender motor direction pin is connected with - A0 pin of arduino

Bender motor step pin is connected with - A1 pin of arduino 

Feeder motor direction pin is connected with - A2 pin of arduino 

Feeder motor step pin is connected with - A3 pin of arduino

A4988 Stepper driver is set at 16 microstepping setting by giving 5V to MAS1 MS2 & MS3 pin of driver

I designe this multipurpose PCB Those who ever worked with arduino they know the pain of connecting multiple components to the arduino for there projects. so here is the answer for you all.

Not only 2 or 3 you can connect 11 components at same time & on board 5V & 9V regulator,

cross polarity protection, power indication LED,

motor power selection provision (5V or 9V or 12V) manual provision for stepper motor microstepping setting.

Wide range of input supply (9V to 24V). This is my multipurpose PCB works with Arduino Nano, I have designed it in a way that you can run 2 Stepper motors, 2 DC motors, 2 Servo motors at same time and this is not it you can even connect BT module, rotary encoder, I2C device, potentiometer at same time.

This PCB is very much helpful in building any project and no need to worry about messy wire connections.

He we first see the overview of PCB means what is this PCB capable of and which components you can connect to the PCB.

# List of the Components you can connect to the PCB

> 2 DC motor ( 9V to 24V DC)

> 2 Potentiometer

> 2 Servo motors ( 5V to 9V DC)

> 1 Serial device (BT module, HMI, Communication module, RX, TX)

> 1 Encoder (2 interrupt pin & 1 PB pin)

> 1 I2C device (SCL/SDA Device, display, MPU6050 etc)

> 2 Stepper motors


# Special features of PCB

> Wide range of power input 9V to 24V DC

I have uploaded all the required [3D parts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3789571) at thingiverse
you can download it and print it, I have printed all parts in PLA and 0.15 layer height and 80% infill on tevo [terantula 3d printer](https://amzn.to/2KhMkPb)

# WIRE BENDING MACHINE ASSEMBLY

First of all I printed all the required 3D parts in PLA material.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19898602/123726171-1fd61e00-d8ad-11eb-8962-965bc0da7665.png)


I mount the parts on 8MM mdf board using M4 bolts and nuts.

After that I assemble the wire straightener system, I have used 3mm bore diameter bearing 693ZZ

Next I mount both stepper motor, I have used 3D printer filament feeder to feed brass wire in machine.

Now I mount the bending arm on the shaft of stepper motor, and next I mount the wire guider on the feeder stepper motor mount.

At last I mount a roller bearing to hold the roll of wire, then PCB is mounted on MDF Board and stepper motion is connected to there terminal.
Here machine assembly is almost done so now we can move towards arduino code.




 
# HOW TO OPERATE WIRE BENDING MACHINE

Connect the power supply to the system, connect arduino and PC with USB cable.
Open the Arduino IDE software launch the serial monitor immediately you will receive a massage to input the data.
suppose you want to make a triangle of 20mm lenght so you need to enter
1,20
The first number before comma is for shape selection and the number after comma are side length.

That’s all for now friends.
